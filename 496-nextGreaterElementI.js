// The next greater element of some element x in an array is the first greater element that is to the right of x in the same array.

// You are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 is a subset of nums2.

// For each 0 <= i < nums1.length, find the index j such that nums1[i] == nums2[j] and determine the next greater element of nums2[j] in nums2. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is -1.

// Return an array ans of length nums1.length such that ans[i] is the next greater element as described above.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
// Output: [-1,3,-1]
// Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
// - 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
// - 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.
// - 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
// Example 2:

// Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]
// Output: [3,-1]
// Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
// - 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. The next greater element is 3.
// - 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
 

// Constraints:

// 1 <= nums1.length <= nums2.length <= 1000
// 0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 104
// All integers in nums1 and nums2 are unique.
// All the integers of nums1 also appear in nums2.
 

// Follow up: Could you find an O(nums1.length + nums2.length) solution?

Time Complexity: O(N^2); worst case I am looping through the entire nums2.length for ever
element that is in nums1(The Actual complexity would be O(nums1^nums2));
this solution only works because the input size is really small
Space Complexity: O(1); no additional space is needed other than the answer;
