// You are given a 0-indexed string blocks of length n, where blocks[i] is either 'W' or 'B', representing the color of the ith block. The characters 'W' and 'B' denote the colors white and black, respectively.

// You are also given an integer k, which is the desired number of consecutive black blocks.

// In one operation, you can recolor a white block such that it becomes a black block.

// Return the minimum number of operations needed such that there is at least one occurrence of k consecutive black blocks.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: blocks = "WBBWWBBWBW", k = 7
// Output: 3
// Explanation:
// One way to achieve 7 consecutive black blocks is to recolor the 0th, 3rd, and 4th blocks
// so that blocks = "BBBBBBBWBW". 
// It can be shown that there is no way to achieve 7 consecutive black blocks in less than 3 operations.
// Therefore, we return 3.
// Example 2:

// Input: blocks = "WBWBBBW", k = 2
// Output: 0
// Explanation:
// No changes need to be made, since 2 consecutive black blocks already exist.
// Therefore, we return 0.
 

// Constraints:

// n == blocks.length
// 1 <= n <= 100
// blocks[i] is either 'W' or 'B'.
// 1 <= k <= n
